        <img src="bby.jpg" alt="About Image">
        <p>I was born and raised here in the City of Pines Baguio City, 
            I am 2nd year college as of now and I am taking a course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in WEB TECH. My lola raised me 
            since I was in kindergarten until now, and I am happy to have her by my side. I am the first child among three brothers.
            I am also planning to shift because IT is so annoying (just kidding!). I love IT because it's flexible and helps me pursue my dreams. IT is one of the most popular fields nowadays.
            That's all about me, now let me introduce you to my hobbies!

                <p>
                    I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball, which Iâ€™ve been involved in since elementary school. I even played in the Palarong Lungsod during elementary and got 2nd place. 
                    Besides sports, I also love playing guitar and singing, which I learned from my father.
